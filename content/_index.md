I'm a fourth-year Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University interested in mechanical autonomy and multi-robot collectives. 

At Cornell, I work in the [Helbling Robotics Laboratory](https://helbling-lab.github.io/) on the electronics and control system of an insect-scale quadruped, the Cornell Multi-Terrain (COMT) robot. The COMT system aims to provide a stable, autonomous platform for the development and implementation of small-scale sensor systems, communication and control of multi-robot collectives, and decision frameworks for resource-constrained locomotion strategies. My work is documented [here](/portfolio/helbling-lab).

I will commission into the United States Air Force in May 2026 as a Combat Systems Officer (CSO) through Air Force ROTC at Cornell. I developed the hardware systems for the first field deployment of a [novel multi-domain effects wargaming platform](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/usafamdl_metis-modular-effects-based-transmitter-activity-7156325086159925248-rMFt/) from the USAFA Multi-Domain Laboratory, enhancing the officer training pipeline nationwide.  -->
