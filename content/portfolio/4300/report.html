<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >Two Boeing 737 MAX aircraft&#8212;Lion Air Flight 610 (Oct. 29, 2018) and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302
(Mar. 10, 2019)&#8212;were lost in accidents that exposed a tightly coupled failure across automation design,
certification practice, organizational decision-making, and operator information/training. The U.S.
FAA grounded the MAX on Mar. 13, 2019 and rescinded the grounding on Nov. 18, 2020.

<!--l. 68--><p class="noindent" >A core design vulnerability was allowing a stability-related control function to command trim in the
presence of bad sensor input without robust, conservative validation of that input. The U.S. House

<!--l. 76--><p class="indent" >   A safety argument that &#8220;the crew will always respond correctly&#8221; is ethically fragile unless it is backed

<!--l. 80--><p class="noindent" >The House report also documents that Boeing tested a single unintended MCAS activation but did <span

<!--l. 92--><p class="indent" >   This matters ethically because transparency is not a public-relations preference; it is a safety control.

technical complexity.

<!--l. 153--><p class="noindent" >The Boeing 737 MAX incidents illustrate a classic sociotechnical failure: a safety-relevant
automation function interacted with sensor faults, human factors realities, organizational incentives,
and certification processes in ways that made catastrophic outcomes possible. The prevention
strategy is therefore also sociotechnical: better fault-tolerant design, better evidence-based
validation of operator interaction, stronger internal transparency and safety culture, and oversight
mechanisms that remain effective under real-world incentives and information asymmetries. <span class="cite">[<span
