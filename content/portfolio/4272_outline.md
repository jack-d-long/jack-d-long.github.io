As part of MAE 4272, you will create a simple professional engineering portfolio and publish a short webpage describing your Blade Design Project. This page is something you can share externally for example with recruiters.

-->

 <!-- Create a page in your portfolio that summarizes your team’s blade design work. This should be written at a level appropriate for a hiring manager or technical recruiter.

Your page must include:

Project overview: What you were asked to design and why

Design process: Key decisions, iterations, or modeling steps your team performed

Testing summary: How the blades were tested and what data you analyzed

Your contribution: Briefly describe what you worked on

Figures: Plots, CAD image, and photos  --> -->


# Overview

MAE 4272 is a lab-based class intended to enage students to actively design, build,
and analyze fluid-thermal systems, linking the fluid-mechanical and thermodynamic/heat-transfer components of the Cornell Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering core curriculum. 

For this class' final project, students (in teams of 3-4) were tasked with designing the blades of a small-scale wind turbine according to a small set of mechanical and environmental constraints. We did this to demonstrate the application of the fluid-thermal analytical techniques learned in class to an open-ended design project.

## Design statement

In teams of 3 to 4 students (assigned), you are tasked with designing the blades of a small-scale wind turbine with the following requirements:

- The blades must have a maximum length of 6 inches, measured from root to tip.  
- The blades must be compatible with a standard hub piece, **1 inch in radius**, whose geometry is provided.  
- The wind turbine must be designed to **operate at a fixed angular velocity** \( \Omega \), whose value is to be determined by your team, but should never exceed **2000 rpm**.  
- The wind turbine must be used in an environment where the wind follows a velocity distribution well described by a Weibull probability distribution with parameters \( k = 5 \) and \( c = 5 \):

$$
p(U) = \left(\frac{k}{c}\right)\left(\frac{U}{c}\right)^{k-1}
\exp\left[-\left(\frac{U}{c}\right)^k\right]
$$

where \( U \) is the incoming wind velocity in m/s.
