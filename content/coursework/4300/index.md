## Summary

This report examines the Boeing 737 MAX accidents (Lion Air 610 and Ethiopian Airlines 302), focusing on how automation design, certification practices, organizational incentives, and operator information/training combined into a systemic failure. The analysis emphasizes engineering ethics in terms of fault tolerance, transparent communication, and safety governance, and distills reforms across technical safeguards, organizational controls, and regulatory oversight.
